== Preface
The CC in the Cloud WG is developing an Essential Security Requirements (ESR) that captures the fundamental requirements. This initial draft contains material that was created by the WG as a framework to utilize Common Criteria methodology for products deployed in a cloud environment.

== Background and Purpose

There is not yet a defined and accepted method within the Common Criteria that addresses IT product evaluations in the cloud environment.

Today, CC reflects a static point in time for security evaluation methodology. Over the past several years, members of this TWG have witnessed customer migrations from an on-premise model where products are liscenced and maintaned to a services model where assurance benefits accrued from CC are not availible in the cloud.

Customers are buying services, not products “Gartner foresees double-digit growth in government use of public cloud services, with spending forecast to grow on average 17.1% per year through 2021.” --Understanding cloud Adoption in Government

“In fiscal 2019, the White House-issued cloud Smart strategy gave agencies a mandate to expedite their journeys to the cloud Federal agencies spent a combined $5.9 billion in contract obligations on cloud infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS), and other cloud support and migration services. They’re on track to spend $7.1 billion in fiscal 2020.”--The State of Federal cloud: Market Briefing

At some point customers are going to recognize that a CC evaluation of an ICT product provides little assurance in a cloud environment. Without a plan for CC addressing this factor, CC will become irrelevant in DevOps and Customers will require additional country specific testing instead.

As the market moves to cloud-based solutions, ISO/IEC15408 should be adapted in order to provide security assurance for cloud scenarios. In addition, vendors of products to be evaluated along with authors of cPP’s aimed at cloud use case evaluations, may need to add or alter specific code or cPP content carefully to ensure evaluate-able products and cPP’s.

== Use Case(s)

Use Case 1: Software as a service (SaaS) a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and it is centrally hosted. It is sometimes referred to as "on-demand software", and was formerly referred to as "software plus services" by Microsoft. SaaS applications are also known as on-demand software and Web-based/Web-hosted software

Use Case 2: Platform as a service (PaaS) or application platform as a service (aPaaS) or platform-based service is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app.

Use Case 3: Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) are online services that provide high-level APIs used to dereference various low-level details of underlying network infrastructure like physical computing resources, location, data partitioning, scaling, security, backup etc. A hypervisor, such as Xen, Oracle VirtualBox, Oracle VM, KVM, VMware ESX/ESXi, or Hyper-V, LXD, runs the virtual machines as guests. Pools of hypervisors within the cloud operational system can support large numbers of virtual machines and the ability to scale services up and down according to customers' varying requirements.

== Known Evaluation Methodology Gaps

=== Analysis is Static
Traditional product evaluations, most equivalent to SaaS use cases, must adopt rigid and static boundaries with regards to product version, platform components, and product scope. These considerations are problematic when adopted to a dynamic operating environment like the cloud.

Explicit detail of all TOE and Platform configurations and interactions between layers is required to ensure validation. cloud certifications would require the concept of a Trusted Platform in which this detail often unknown and quickly perishable, but the security posture is not diminished.

=== Use of Cryptography
Current cryptography certification frameworks rely on extremely detailed algorithm, implementation, and entropy details that are not always availible or predicatble to end users or product vendors on various cloud platforms or environments.

=== Platform Abstraction
Existing TOE composition requires stability in both the TOE and TOE Platform. The TOE operating environment in a cloud use case may or may not change dramatically due to a variety of factors such as hardware deprecation, underlying firmware updates, OS changes, etc. These changes may or may not be detected by the TOE and may or may not affect the TOE security posture. 

New methodology to address minimum satisfactory capabilities in this regard will be needed to bridge this gap.

=== Environmental Evolution
Cloud environments have extremely limited half-lives. Traditional certifications can not match pace. Furthermore, as cloud Hosting agreements are negotiated indepedently, access to the same platform or platforms used to evaluate a product cannot be guaranteed to the Common Criteria end user. 

== Proposed Approaches for Extending Evaluations to the Cloud

=== Create SDs for PP authors to offer an approach for evaluating Cloud-based products and services.

==== Provide additional threat model concerns for CCitC

The iTC will continue to review and monitor relevant Cloud Security Frameworks to capture additional threat considerations or assurance requirements. The following items were identified as particularly relevant for CC in the Cloud efforts.

===== Configuration
As cloud environments offer tremendous benefits of scale to IT Solutions, it is beneficial for product vendors to leverage autonomous deployment and delivery of TOE components. Traditional CC evidence such as Guidance Supplements or access to physical hardware may be difficult for cloud evaluations.

For example, container respositories and/or container orchestration configurations respresent and area of interest for products and services using a cloud model that would require attention from PP Authors or Evaluators targetting CC in the Cloud evalutaions. 

===== Credentials
Traditional CC evaluations typically rely on tusted network or administrator assumptions with regards to credentials and credential managment. As cloud environments inherently challenge these assumptions, it is critical to extended SFRs and SARs to meet additonal TOE security objectives.

It is not sufficient to solely rely on data at rest protections for credentials or key material. CC in the Cloud evaluations must consider the entire lifecylce of secrets, (to include generation, destruction, revocation, etc) as well as any escrow needed to maintain product operations.

For example, a SaaS application that connects to a datastore may or may not be provisioned manualy or programtically. PP Authors that wish to evluate Applications in a Cloud Deployment must ensure that credentials used to connect and encrypt/decrypt data within the Cloud Platform are not vulnerable to compromise.  

===== Key Management
Cloud service models inherently require compute, network, and storage resources to be dynamically provisioned and de-provisioned programatically. This presents unique challenges with providing encryption capabilities due to the need to orchestrate key management and delivery. CC in the Cloud considerations must extend assurance such that these capabilities are clearly defined and understood within the scope of evaluation.

For example, Virtual Machines or Containers that leverage encrypted storage volumes often require additional operational components to provide pre-boot authentication and/or HSM services for decryption operations. The Key Heirachy and lifecylce within the CC in the Cloud use case are of additional concern in this threat model.

===== Insider Threat
Products and services provided through the cloud require trust on behalf of the vendors and user that extends to operational personell far above non-cloud deployments.

This iTC will consider requirements or expansion of scope that includes ALC deliverables to satisfy these additional threat concerns.

===== Multi-tenant
Convential CC evaluations typically assume that the TOE platform or underlying infastructure is controlled at the enterprise level by a singular entity within the enterprise. In cloud environments, this assumption can not be included as the nature of cloud services inherently introduces an aspect of multiple enterprises (multi-tenant) sharing resources both physical and logical. 

For example, cloud customers of ICT products understand that moving to the cloud means sharing infastrcuture with other customers. While Cloud Providers offering IaaS capabilities may offer dedicated hardware or instances to one cloud customer, this is the minority of cloud use cases.

This iTC will consider products deployed in a multitenant evironment with respect to any optional or objective SFRs involving cloud use cases that mitigate Guest Escape, Data Leakage, Privlege Escalation, etc.

=== Evaluate related approaches for re-use in CCitC

==== Evaluate MDM Equivalency appendix for re-use in CC in the Cloud SDs to address trusted platform issues
Review FIPS I.G G.5 for examples of post-validation equivalency arguments.

==== Identify procurement requirements for Cloud and propose updates to utilize CC in the Cloud outputs

Functionality-related requirements are:

** TOE must be resillient to underlying platform changes.
** Risk management must be applied to the range of changes that are acceptable. 

== Assumptions

=== Trusted Platform
* Cloud based service models inherently incur a trust relationship to certain components of the Information Technology solution. As such, the level and functionality of this trust must be codified by the following considerations:

** The platform provider must:
*** Specify any existing Common Criteria Certificates valid for the TOE Environment.
*** Specify any existing cryptographic collateral information (e.g. FIPS 140, ISO/IEC 19790 or equivalent ) for the TOE Environment.
*** Specify any existing TCG TPM information for the TOE Environment.
*** If no collateral as noted above is availible:
**** The platform providers must identify make, model, and version of any 

=== Trusted Provider/Admin
* Cloud based service models inherently incur a trust relationship to certain components of the Information Technology solution. As such, the level and functionality of this trust must be codified by the following considerations:

** The platform provider must:
*** Specify any existing governmental authorizations (e.g. FEDRAMP, CMMC) applicable for the TOE Environment.
*** Specify any existing ISO/IEC 27001/2 certificate informaiton.
*** Specify any existing ISO/IEC 20243 (e.g. Open Group Trusted Technology Provider Standard) certificate information for the TOE Environment.
*** If no collateral as noted above is availible:
**** The platform providers must identify make, model, and version of any 

== Outside the Scope of Evaluation
[NOTE]
====
Things listed here can be explicitly excluded from consideration for requirements. For example types of attacks that may not be readily able to be handled or are just considered out of scope (such as for USB where a device is compromised and returned to the user). 

Things listed here may end up being used in ESRs for PP-Modules based on a base-PP later. For example, additional functionality of the device (such as a VPN gateway on top of a network device) may be excluded here.
